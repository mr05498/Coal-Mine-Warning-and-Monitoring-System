This paper presents a novel system designed to determine the warning level of a coal mine by integrating the assessment of its structural integrity with the analysis of gas concentration levels. The project aims to address the critical need for effective monitoring and early warning systems in coal mines to mitigate potential hazards and ensure the safety of miners.

The importance of this research lies in the inherent risks associated with coal mining operations, including the potential for structural failures and the presence of hazardous gases such as methane. Accurate and timely evaluation of these risks is crucial to prevent accidents, minimize environmental impact, and protect the lives of workers. The objectives of this system are twofold; to develop a comprehensive approach that combines structural monitoring techniques with gas concentration measurements, and to generate a warning that provides real-time risk assessment and alerts based on the integrated data.

Overall, this paper highlights the development and implementation of an early warning and monitoring system that leverages camera imagery, machine learning, and gas sensors to enhance safety in hazardous mine environments. The system's ability to detect structural instability and monitor gas concentrations offers an effective solution for mitigating risks and safeguarding the well-being of mine workers. Through this research, significant advancements in mining safety practices can be achieved, leading to improved safety standards and reduced incidents in coal mines.
